        <p class="about">The company came about from my experience in the military and my admiration for the seal of the United States. The logo is based off that. The government has many departments to run many things. What they don't seem to have is a department for active health and exercise, other than the FDA. I feel they don't have the right mindset, and due to bureaucracy, will not ever take an official stance on any topic other than generalizations. They also can't focus on individuals.</p>

<p class="about">On top of that, I aim to service Government Contracts for the Army and other branches to help with overweight soldiers and their physical readiness. There is a serious problem, and from personal experience, being healthy and fit makes the job much easier. So in keeping with the appearance in an attempt to have fun AND make my company look and feel more legitimate, I created the name of the company; Department of Athletics.

        <p class="about">I'm in my mid-30s. I'm 5' 9.75" tall and I've been 163lbs and 18% body fat and as big as 230lbs+ at 34% body fat. A few times. Through all of this, I have discovered that my ideal shape and size is 177lbs and 16% body fat</p>
		<p class="about">I grew up in a very artistic area, lots of influences to choose from. And for a while I was convinced that I was going to be a paper and pen medium artist. Either a panel artist or inker. Maybe both. But I landed a stroke of luck by landing a job in a hobby and interest of mine; blacksmithing. And it opened me up to something I prefer much more: Craftsmanship. Making things. The modern term 'maker' may be more familiar to you. The process of taking raw metals and turning it into a fence, gate, fireplace screen, swords, knives, artistic representations of nature...it's so fulfilling. And I did pick up on some other skills. Masonry, carpentry & woodworking, glassblowing, throwing pottery...you get the idea. In this time, I had noticed how fit I was. </p>
		<p class="about">While working there, I wanted to go to college, shut the parents up too. So, I went for a culinary degree. A few thoughts on why: I already knew how to cook extremely well; I didn't want to work in a kitchen for the rest of my life, so I took advantage of the statistics about obtaining a degree and not finding a job in said degree. So, I'm a certified chef; it placated the parents; an easy degree. For me anyway.</p>
		<p class="about">At the age of 19 I moved away from home. Whole lotta drama behind it and not the place for it. I ended up in Maine working for a Tax software company. I've always had a knack for computers and technology. Back in high school I was the bane of our network admin. I always found ways to download games and access e-mail and other websites. But I digress. This was a great job until after a few years we were bought out and shut down. I spent an entire year unemployed trying to find a GOOD job to pay the bills. In the time from moving up there, after 5 years, I had ballooned up to 220 lbs. Sedentary lifestyles do that to you.</p>
		<p class="about">By 25 I was in the Army. It was the only way out of a podunk town that couldn't pay enough to keep up my bills. I lost 10 pounds before entering basic training, all I did was stop drinking soda. I switched to water and low-calorie juices. And by the end of 8 weeks in basic, I emerged at 163lbs and a staggering 15% body fat. I could run for miles (for reference I couldn't even run 1/8 mile in under 10 minutes when I entered basic, just awful) and then some. I eventually got stationed and due to microfractures from improper self-care, I was put on a no-run profile. My body was stressed so much I was packing away over 4,000 calories per day and wasn't gaining weight. But when I got hit with that profile, I didn't adjust for the lack of exercise I wasn't getting. Within a few weeks, I backtracked on 4 monthsâ€™ worth of work. I still have the stretch marks from how fast I gained weight. And I stayed at 210 pounds through deployment. I didn't take my fitness seriously until my remaining 6 months. And boy, did I haul ass. I dropped back down to 174 and 18% body fat within a matter of a few weeks, I missed my PT badge by 5 push-ups. My 2-mile run was sub 12 minutes. I had become obsessed with, at least, the idea of fitness and conditioning. I had squandered a few years and I didn't like it.</p>
		<p class="about">When I left the Army, I used my GI Bill for the next degree, certification in ACE (American Council on Exercise) Modality. I am always looking for a job to pay my bills and the first to hire gets the loyalty. I also, technically, do not make a great successful trainer because I suck at taking your money. I care so much about the person training I'd rather set them up for success then let them fail over something like money. Everyone deserves that person who is dedicated to helping. But I graduated and spent the next few years just milling about, gaining more weight, not really putting that degree to use.</p>
		<p class="about">2015 rolled around and I got thin for the wrong reason, for a girl, I didn't do it for myself. And it failed. And to this day I struggle with weight worse than ever before. Not only because I'm aging, but because of HOW I lost the weight. I didn't use any illegal substances. But I did use supplements. Essentially one was a caffeine pill (same brand I used in the military), the next was a Ketone. These two acted as hunger suppressants, and I didn't realize what was happening. At the end of 8 weeks I was eating less than 100 calories a day. Then I added in a diuretic the last couple weeks to cut another percent or two. But I stopped working out and went on the 3-week vacation and pigged out. I still managed to lose an additional 10 pounds and cut down to 174 pounds again. A lean 16% body fat. However, it didn't last because I went back to old habits when things didn't work out.</p>
		<p class="about">In 2016 I went back to school again with some more of the GI Bill for anther certification but in the NASM (National Academy of Sports Medicine) Modality. I squandered that as well. And here we are today. I am working on another degree but not related to health and wellness. So not important. What IS important is I'm getting more comfortable with taking your money in connection to training.</p>
