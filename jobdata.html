<h1>What Does a Trainer or Coach Do?</h1>
<div class="welcome">

  <div class="collapsible-content2">
    <div class="content-inner">
        <p class="about">In reality, not much. Not even a high school diploma. Knowledge of anatomy and exercise science is the true cornerstone to becoming a trainer. However, gyms and clubs prefer to hire those that are certified through a proper asscoiation like <a class="form1" href="https://www.nasm.org/bundles">NASM</a> or <a class="form1" href="https://www.acefitness.org/fitness-certifications/personal-trainer-certification/how-to-become-a-personal-trainer.aspx">ACE</a> (National Academy of Sports Medicine and American Council on Exercise, respectively).</p>
		<p class="about">The reason for this is because with certification you have a rigid requirement to know things like the Krebs Cycle, VO2<sub>MAX</sub>, how to identify when someone is in exercise related distress, CPR and AED training, even some information on medications and how to avoid exercise related injuries. You have to study up on all of that and more. This isn't something that's specifically taught in schools. The other option you have is to go through college programs that teach this. Your certifications will come through that process naturally.</p>

  <div class="collapsible-content2">
    <div class="content-inner">
      <p class="about">We are needed everywhere, even if it doesn't seem like it. Being a trainer or coach is really just the beginning level of fitness and health. We can go on to become nutritionists, physical therapists, professional athletic trainers, private instructors, or even a media personality.</p>
	  <p class="about">The job market is expected to grow to over 315,000 jobs in the fitness industry by 2026 at a current rate of 10% faster than average. And this is a job that will always need to be around. Everyone in the world could learn what know but there will still be people who need that accountability or push. We are only human, after all.</p>
	  <p class="about">We can work in hospitals, schools, gyms, sports, company health centers, malls, private studios, homes, and even public parks.</p>

  <label for="collapsible4" class="lbl-toggle">How Much Do We Make?</label>
  <div class="collapsible-content2">
    <div class="content-inner">
      <p class="about">The amount of money we make varies depending on where and how we work. On average, we tend to make around $20/hr. You may notice gyms charge a bit more than that for training with one of their trainers. I've seen places charge as much $50/hr for nothing more than telling someone what to do and only pay the trainer $15/hr out of that $50. Top pay for trainers range from $70-$80k/year. And while this seems great, your yearly salary can vary from year to year. And some parts of the year could be leaner than others. Major holidays, New Year's, and a few weeks leading up to summer are among the busiest and where most of the money is made. This is all based around working as a club or gym trainer. As a private trainer it is possible to make so much more money than what's reported on statistic sites.</p>
	  <p class="about">As a private trainer we can tailor pricing and programs without having to worry about corporate standards and goals. We can also control our facilty resource use like electricity and water. Unlike public gyms and clubs we don't need to keep the lights on when no one is in the building simply because of 'open' hours. We can run off of appointment and even train in other places than a studio.</p>
	  <p class="about">Another thing that affects your pay are specialty focuses. Like a physical therapist or nutritionist. I'm sure many people reading this are familiar with Tom Brady, the quarterback for the New England Patriots. His personal trainer had a specialty in a few things, but one that made a huge difference was Corrective Exercise. This allows us to help spur recovery and even prevent it. It's a special focus on restoring muscles and tissue back to a neutral state to optimize movement and strength. This is how he has kept his shoulder in such good working order in his late age as a quarterback.</p>
